## John Horton Conway's Game of Life

The purpose of this app if for users to experiment with the cellular automtaton, run the simulation and modify the grid cells to see the respective effects.<br />
The app features instructions, the ability to insert popular pattern presets, a speed slider to adjust simulation speed and the ability to randomize the grid cells.<br />

### `About the Conway's Game of Life`

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life<br />

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
